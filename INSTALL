Installation
============
Chroma uses the standard procedure for compilation and installation:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

By default, this will attempt to build both the graphical (SDL) and the
terminal (curses) versions of Chroma, although the configure script may be
given either '--disable-curses' or '--disable-sdl' as options if required.

Dependencies
============
The SDL version of Chroma requires the following libraries:

    * SDL
      http://www.libsdl.org/

    * SDL_image
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

    * FreeType 2
      http://www.freetype.org/

It also uses the font "DejaVu Sans" - see graphics/font.txt for its licence:

    * DejaVu fonts
      http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/ 

The curses version of Chroma requires a curses library such as:

    * ncurses
      http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/

Both versions require:

    * gettext
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

Most linux distributions should have pre-built packages for all of these. Note
that you will require both the library and development (often -devel) packages.

Cross-compilation for Windows
=============================
Chroma may be cross-compiled for Windows using MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/).
A separate Makefile.mingw is provided for this purpose, although you will need
to ensure the libraries mentioned above are present in your MinGW installation.
PDCurses (http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/) may be used in place of ncurses.
